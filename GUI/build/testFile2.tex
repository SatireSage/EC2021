\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sum_{a = 0}^n a^10$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  For some $x > 1$, sketch the region that the function $\displaystyle{A(x) = \int_{-1}^x (3 + t^2)\,dt}$ represents the area of.
\item  Use the fact that $\displaystyle{\int_a^b u^2\,du = \frac{b^3-a^3}{3}}$ and $\displaystyle{\int_a^bc\,du = c(b-a)}$, and the rules of combining definite integrals to find an expression for $A(x)$ and simplify that expression.
\smallskip
\item  Compute $A'(x)$.
\smallskip
\item  For a small positive number $h$, sketch the region whose area is represented by \\$A(x + h) - A(x)$.
\smallskip
\item  Use your picture, and maybe a rectangle, to explain why $\displaystyle{\frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} \approx 3 + x^2}$.
\smallskip
\item  Based on part (e), give both an intuitive reason and a logical reason using the limit definition of the derivative for why your answer in (c) makes sense.
