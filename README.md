# EC2021
Programming Category

To run this program, download the repository first. Inside the installers folder, run installer.exe by double-clicking it. Then run installer2.exe. After running the two installation exectuables, gui.exe should appear in the same directory. Run gui.exe and you should be greated with the interface for the program. Inside this interface you can select the *.tex file that you wish to interpret, making sure to press the "Set" button first before hitting "Play". We have provided a test file called testFile2.tex under the pre-GUI folder in the EC2021 directory.
